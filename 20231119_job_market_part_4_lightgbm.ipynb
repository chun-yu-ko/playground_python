    " - Objective: Analyze changes in Data Science and Analytics (DSA) job content over the past 10 months in Taipei.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Data Collection: Compilation of job data in Taipei, focusing on positions related to Data Science and Analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Data Scope: The dataset includes some positions that may not be directly relevant to DSA.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Initial Step: Filter out job postings that are not pertinent to DSA.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Analysis Method: Employ dynamic topic modeling to identify shifts in the content of DSA job descriptions during the 10-month period."
