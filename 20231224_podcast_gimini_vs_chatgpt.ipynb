      "Topic: Casual Inference\n",
      "\n",
      "Notes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Introduction:\n",
      "   - Welcome to Casual Inference, a podcast hosted by Lucy D'Agostino-McGowan and Ellie Murray.\n",
      "   - Today's special episode features a conversation with Ralph D'Agostino Sr. and Ralph D'Agostino Jr., Lucy's father and grandfather, respectively.\n",
      "   - Both Ralph Sr. and Ralph Jr. are distinguished statisticians and epidemiologists with extensive contributions to their fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Ralph D'Agostino Sr.'s Contributions:\n",
      "   - Worked at United Brands, Hanscom Field, and the FDA.\n",
      "   - Involved in the Framingham Heart Study, where he developed risk functions and predictive models for cardiovascular disease.\n",
      "   - Collaborated with the FBI to analyze serial killer activities.\n",
      "   - Conducted research on emergency room treatments for cardiovascular conditions.\n",
      "   - Served as co-principal investigator of the Framingham study from 2007 to 2015.\n",
      "   - Currently studying cardiovascular risk in the HIV population.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Ralph D'Agostino Jr.'s Contributions:\n",
      "   - Worked on a project related to asbestos exposure in the environment during his PhD studies.\n",
      "   - Focused on observational data sets and causal inference throughout his career.\n",
      "   - Developed propensity score methods and wrote a tutorial on their application in epidemiology and clinical research.\n",
      "   - Initially faced challenges in getting people to use propensity scores correctly, but later shifted focus to helping researchers use them appropriately.\n",
      "   - Currently interested in conducting valid causal inference using non-randomized data collected in non-standardized ways from large, publicly available databases.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Discussion on the Framingham Heart Study:\n",
      "   - Ralph Sr. joined the study in 1981 and observed that logistic regression was being used to relate risk factors to coronary heart disease.\n",
      "   - He suggested using Cox regression instead, which allowed for following individuals over longer periods and relating baseline data to cardiovascular disease occurrence.\n",
      "   - The Framingham functions developed using Cox regression worked well on Framingham data and were validated on other studies, establishing their usefulness in predicting cardiovascular risk.\n",
      "   - The Framingham functions became a standard for developing guidelines on when to start treating individuals for cardiovascular disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Discussion on the Resurgence of Causal Inference Methods:\n",
      "   - Ralph Jr. attributes the renewed interest in causal inference to increased data availability, computational advancements, and the emergence of larger publicly available databases.\n",
      "   - These factors have enabled more researchers to access data and conduct causal inference studies without having to construct cohorts themselves.\n",
      "   - The development of tutorials and resources explaining causal inference methods has also contributed to their wider adoption.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Perspectives on the Future of Epidemiology and Biostatistics:\n",
      "   - Ralph Sr. emphasizes the importance of version science, where research is conducted collaboratively and builds upon previous findings.\n",
      "   - He envisions real-time dashboards for scientific research, allowing for continuous monitoring of progress and updating of results.\n",
      "   - Ralph Jr. highlights the need for collaboration and coordination among scientists to coalesce information and identify important research questions.\n",
      "   - Both Ralph Sr. and Ralph Jr. stress the crucial role of statisticians and data scientists in interpreting and communicating research results to non-quantitative audiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Conclusion:\n",
      "   - The conversation concludes with gratitude expressed to Ralph Sr. and Ralph Jr. for sharing their insights and contributions to the fields of statistics and epidemiology.\n"
